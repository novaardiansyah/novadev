# NovaDev - Personal URL Shortener

Welcome to **NovaDev**! A modern personal URL shortener service built with Next.js and TypeScript. This project features a clean redirect page with countdown timer, perfect for creating short, shareable links.

Ideal for learning modern web development patterns, responsive design, and best practices. Environment configurations are personalized for security, but I'm happy to help with any questions about the implementation.
