# NovaApp - React Native Finance Management

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to **NovaApp**! A modern React Native finance management application built with Expo and TypeScript. This project showcases a complete authentication flow with Laravel Sanctum API integration, featuring a clean UI with Material Design principles and robust user management.

This repository is my personal React Native project evolved from previous learning experiments. Here, I've implemented modern mobile development patterns, authentication flows, and best practices—ideal for learning, reference, or as a foundation for your own mobile applications. To showcase my skills, state management, navigation, and UI components have been carefully crafted and organized.

While this repository is public, please note that environment configuration files and API access credentials are **not provided**. Although you can study the code structure and implementation patterns, access to the backend API and sensitive configuration remains restricted for security reasons. However, I'm always open to discuss and help if you need guidance regarding mobile development or React Native best practices.
